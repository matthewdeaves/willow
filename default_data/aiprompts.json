Follow these guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Analyze the article's body and title text using keyword extraction and semantic analysis to identify key themes and topics.\r\n* Incorporate one or more tags from the existing tags provided if they are relevant. Avoid creating new tags that are synonymous with existing ones (e.g., use existing tag 'Web Development' instead of a new tag 'Website Development').\r\n* If no existing tags are relevant, create new tags that accurately reflect the article's content.\r\n* Ensure the tags are concise, precise, and reflect the main themes of the article.\r\n* Handle cases where fewer than 6 tags are appropriate by providing only the most relevant ones.\r\n\r\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object containing a single key \"tags\" with an array of up to 6 new and\/or existing tags as its value.
